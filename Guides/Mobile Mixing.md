Big thanks to @SamouraiWallet & @DiverterBTC, this guide was composed of info from their tweet threads

First, you need some coins in your wallet. The smallest amount you can mix is a little above 0.01005 BTC. If your wallet is empty, hit the blue **"+"** & then add some funds using the **"Receive"** action

Open Whirlpool by pressing the blue **"+"** in the bottom right corner of the screen. This will launch the Whirlpool service to get mixing started.

Press the blue whirlpool icon in the bottom right corner of the screen and then choose **"Mix UTXOs"**

Select the UTXO(s) in your wallet that you want to mix.

Then select a pool to mix in & choose an appropriate miner fee. Keep in mind that mixing will not begin until a confirmation is received on the blockchain.
What about coordinator fees? With Whirlpool you pay a one-time 5% fee of the size of the pool you're entering, **NOT** the amount of the BTC you are mixing, then remix as many times as you'd like for free.

Review the details of this mix, and then press **"Begin Cycle"**

Decide what you want to do with the Toxic Change output (unmixed) - Press yes (recommended) to mark the UTXO as **"Do Not Spend"** - which you can then make spendable at a later date.
The automatic labeling of "toxic change" from your Whirlpool Tx0 is great. This label will stay, even if you uninstall/reinstall from  your encrypted backup.
Labels are another helpful tool to manage UTXOs and avoid privacy slips.

**If you restore from mnenomic the labels will be lost, but you can apply manually again.**

Wait for the screen to load, and you will see your **"Premix"** UTXO(s) waiting to be mixed. Once they receive a single confirmation on the blockchain, mixing will begin
You can keep track of your Whirlpool balances by simply tapping the balance amount at the top of main screen. It will cycle between, Pre-, Post-, and total Whirlpool amount.

Once mixed the UTXO(s) will disappear from the main view, but you can view all the funds by pressing the list icon in the toolbar

The Unspent Outputs list will display all mixed outputs. Why not write a note to remind yourself of what you just accomplished!

You can tap the Samourai logo on the main balance screen to easily switch to the Postmix Balance screen. Likewise, tap the whirlpool icon in the top left toolbar to switch back to the main Balance Screen.

Postmix spending is very important! You can select a single UTXO by long-pressing one from your postmix & spend it alone. 
Spending from Postmix, the change stays in postmix its **NEVER** mixed in a TX with unmixed bitcoin. Long-press the change UTXO(s) in post-mix, you get the option to either mark as unspendable, send back to Whirlpool, or spend by itself again. Up to you, just press and go!
A short press selection of a Postmix UTXO gets you the options on left. Also shows the option to add your personal notes to each UTXO so you know where it's from/been.
