# Masanari Wallet

### Origin

Masanari was forked from [Samourai-wallet-android](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android/commit/87f67e74632e1326685e9a2ec81e395f7e73f18e) (version 0.98.86) on september 30, 2018.

This version still contains the "FIAT" source-code,
which was removed in the [original code](https://blog.samouraiwallet.com/post/178536644472/09887-welcome-new-international-users-and)
and [wont](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jtp75/users_will_never_be_ready_samourai_wallet_drops/e6v7vzg/) be coming back.

### Main changes and plans for Masanari

* Bring back fiat currency (done)
* Keep merging bugfix patches from orininal project (done. Up-to-date with v0.98.89)
* Implement **bits** denomination: 1 bit = 100 satoshis ([bip-176](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0176.mediawiki) by Jimmy Song)
* Add Dutch language (done)
* (Option) Remove "premium" functions if they require Samourai developers fees (Both for Ricochet transactions (0.002 BTC) and intitial PaymentNym payment code (0.00015 BTC))
* Make wallet function without the need for backend API's of samouraiwallet.com
* Refactor code (make classes smaller, cleanup) and add unit tests (currently none)
* Work towards a stable version instead of adding more features
