### Features:

[Samourai Wallet features list](Samourai-Wallet-features.md)

### Build:

Import as Android Studio project. Should build "as is". PGP signed tagged releases correspond to builds that were issued via Google Play.

### BIP44:

Samourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), extends [bitcoinj](https://bitcoinj.github.io/).

### BIP47:

Samourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0047.mediawiki) by Justus Ranvier. Extends BIP44 implementation (above). Further modifications have been made to incorporate Segwit addresses into BIP47.

[BIP47 test vectors](https://gist.github.com/SamouraiDev/6aad669604c5930864bd)

### BIP49 (Segwit):

Samourai P2SH-P2WPKH implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0049.mediawiki) by Daniel Weigl and includes support for BIP49-specific XPUBs: [YPUB](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/sentinel-android/issues/16).

### BIP69:

Samourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0069.mediawiki) by Kristov Atlas.

### BIP84 (Segwit):

Samourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0084.mediawiki) by Pavol Rusnak.

### BIP125 (Replace-by-fee, RBF):

Samourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki) by David A. Harding and Peter Todd.

### BIP141 (Segwit):

Samourai spends to bech32 addresses P2WPKH based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) by Eric Lombrozo, Johnson Lau and Pieter Wuille.

### BIP173 (Segwit):

Samourai implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki) by Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell.

### BIP174 (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction Format, PSBT):

Samourai signing via PSBT implementation based on [original BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki) by  Andrew Chow.

### Spending:

Samourai spends include the possibility of including custom fees as well as the use of batch spending (build up a list of batched outputs for grouped spend and fee savings).

### Ricochet:

Samourai implementation of multi-hop spend designed to outrun the baying pack of #KYCRunningDogs.

Ricochet using nLockTime (staggered) will spread out hops over different blocks and make sure that hops do not appear all at once in the mempool.

### STONEWALL:

STONEWALL spend is designed to increase the number of combinations between inputs and outputs (transaction entropy). It replaces the previously used BIP126. The objective is to obtain a positive entropy score using [Boltzmann](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/boltzmann) evaluation of the transaction.

### Stowaway:

A Stowaway spend, also implemented as [PayJoin](https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/payjoin/), is a collaborative-spend carried out with another user. UTXOs are joined and the spend amount is cloaked. It is based on an [idea](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=139581.0) by Gregory Maxwell. 

### Tor:

Includes Tor bundled in-app.

### TestNet3:

MainNet/TestNet selection is displayed when sideloading a new installation. To switch networks, make a backup of your current wallet, uninstall/reinstall (sideload) and select desired network.

### OpenDime:

Plug in your OpenDime using the appropriate OTG (On-The-Go) USB cable and Samourai can be used to view address and balance, validate the private key, and sweep balance to your wallet.
