### Spending:

Samourai spends include the possibility of including custom fees as well as the use of batch spending (build up a list of batched outputs for grouped spend and fee savings).

### Ricochet:

Samourai implementation of multi-hop spend designed to outrun the baying pack of #KYCRunningDogs.

### STONEWALL:

STONEWALL spend is designed to increase the number of combinations between inputs and outputs (transaction entropy). It replaces the previously used BIP126. The objective is to obtain a positive entropy score using [Boltzmann](https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/boltzmann) evaluation of the transaction.

### Tor:

Samourai indicates whether or not connections are being routed via Tor Socks5 proxy (uses Orbot).

### TestNet3:

MainNet/TestNet selection is displayed when sideloading a new installation. To switch networks, make a backup of your current wallet, uninstall/reinstall (sideload) and select desired network.

### OpenDime:

Plug in your OpenDime using the appropriate OTG (On-The-Go) USB cable and Samourai can be used to view address and balance, validate the private key, and sweep balance to your wallet.
